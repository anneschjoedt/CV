            <div class="about-description">Carolina Sartori has recently obtained a Master degree in Architecture at
                Politecnico of Milan, after a
                Bachelor in Archiecture and Fine Arts at IUAV in Venice.

                She was teaching assistant of Renato Rizzi at IUAV and she contributed to several publications such
                asRenato Rizzi, LAMPEDUSA - La Cattedrale di Salomon | Il libro del lavoro - vol. II, Mimesis Edizioni.
                Furthermore, she participated as a collaborator to Orpheusâ€™ Ground exhibition at Venice Biennale of
                Architecture XV, Reporting from the Front (2016).

                As an architect she worked with OMA/AMO based in Rotterdam and SANAA based in Tokyo.
                As a photographer she worked with Ugo Carmeni Photography Studio in Venice, where she started to explore
                the medium of photography as another eye through which see reality, within the potential of its
                reinterpretation.

                The image becomes a tool to examine the multiple vibrations and (inter)actions between things and world.
                The will to make these tensions tangible implies the ability to listen and to abstract these invisible
                powers.</div>
